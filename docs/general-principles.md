# 2. General Principles

## 2.1 Readability First {#readability-first}
Code is read more often than it is written. Prefer clear names and straightforward logic over clever tricks.

## 2.2 Maintainability {#maintainability}
Organize code so future changes are easy. Break large functions into smaller parts and avoid duplication.

## 2.3 Performance Considerations {#performance}
Optimize only when necessary. Measure bottlenecks before making changes and keep algorithms as simple as possible.

## 2.4 Security Practices {#security}
Validate user input, escape dynamic content, and keep dependencies updated to minimize vulnerabilities.
