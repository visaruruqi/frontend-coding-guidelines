# 3. Code Formatting

Consistent formatting reduces cognitive overhead, keeps diffs focused on meaningful changes, and helps teams review and merge code faster.
The sections below outline the core conventions we follow.

- [3.1 Indentation & Spacing](./indentation-and-spacing.md)
- [3.2 Line Length](./line-length.md)
- [3.3 Semicolons](./semicolons.md)
- [3.4 Quotation Marks](./quotation-marks.md)
- [3.5 Braces & Parentheses Style](./braces-and-parentheses.md)
- [3.6 Trailing Commas](./trailing-commas.md)

These rules are automatically enforced by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and validated with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
Both tools run in CI to ensure consistent style across the codebase.
