# 1.1 Purpose of the Guidelines

A few releases ago, the team felt the pain of inconsistent code. Each contributor used different naming conventions and file structures, leaving pull requests full of nitpicks and new hires puzzled by conflicting patterns. Features took longer to ship because reviewers argued over style instead of functionality.

These guidelines turn that chaos into a shared standard. By agreeing on common practices, the team can focus on solving problems while reviews become smoother and code more predictable.

Consistent practices also pay off in the long term. A unified style reduces technical debt, making the codebase easier to maintain and evolve as the project grows.
