# 9. Framework-Specific Guidelines

This section collects guidance for popular JavaScript frameworks used by the
team. The patterns in this repository draw on the best practices from the
ecosystems below and can be adapted as new frameworks emerge.

## Covered frameworks

Our current recommendations focus on:

- **React** – see the [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn) and the
  [React community style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react).
- **Angular** – refer to the official
  [Angular style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) for detailed
  conventions.
- **Vue** – follow the [Vue style guide](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/) for
  idiomatic component design.

### Adapting to other frameworks

While these frameworks are highlighted today, the underlying patterns are
framework-agnostic. As new frameworks gain traction, these guidelines should be
treated as adaptable templates rather than fixed rules.
