# 4. Naming Conventions

Names should be descriptive and meaningful. When you read a name, its purpose or
value should be immediately clear. Functions always start with a verb that
expresses the action they perform.

```js
// Bad
let x = 5
function data() {}

// Good
let userAge = 5
function fetchData() {}
```
