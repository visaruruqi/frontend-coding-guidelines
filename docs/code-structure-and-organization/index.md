# 6. Code Structure & Organization

Effective projects rely on a **modular architecture** where features are
split into small, focused pieces. Keeping modules self‑contained lowers
the risk of side effects, makes code easier to test, and allows teams to
evolve the codebase with confidence. The sections below outline
practices that support this maintainable structure.

- [File Structure](./file-structure.md) – establish a predictable
  directory layout so modules can be found and reused.
- [Module Imports & Exports](./module-imports-exports.md) – craft small
  modules with clear interfaces to encourage reuse and testability.
- [Separation of Concerns](./separation-of-concerns.md) – keep each
  component focused on a single task to reduce coupling and simplify
  maintenance.
- [Commenting & Documentation](./commenting-and-documentation.md) –
  document modules and their APIs to help future contributors.
- [TODO & FIXME](./todo-fixme.md) – manage temporary code with clear
  markers that facilitate cleanup.
