# 2. General Principles

Strong frontend code stands on four pillars: readability, maintainability, performance, and security.

- **Readability** keeps code clear for people, making collaboration and review easier. Learn more in [Readability First](./readability-first.md).
- **Maintainability** ensures the codebase can evolve smoothly and remain easy to modify. See [Maintainability](./maintainability.md).
- **Performance** delivers fast user experiences by optimizing where it counts. Explore [Performance Considerations](./performance.md).
- **Security** safeguards users and data by preventing common vulnerabilities. Review [Security Practices](./security.md).
