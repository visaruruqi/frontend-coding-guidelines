# 10. Tooling & Automation

Automation keeps our codebase consistent and prevents common mistakes from
slipping into production. The tools below integrate into local development and
continuous integration to enforce these guidelines automatically.

- [10.1 ESLint Rules](./eslint-rules.md) — static analysis to flag errors and
  enforce best practices.
- [10.2 Prettier Config](./prettier-config.md) — opinionated formatting for a
  unified code style.
- [10.3 Git Hooks (Husky)](./git-hooks.md) — runs checks before commits and
  pushes.
