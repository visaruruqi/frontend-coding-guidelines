# Consistent Casing Patterns

- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions:

```js
let myVariable = 0
function calculateTotal() {}
```

- Use `PascalCase` for classes and constructors:

```js
class User {}
class ApiClient {}
```

- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants:

```js
const MAX_RETRIES = 3
```
